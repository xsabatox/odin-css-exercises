Exercise 01 - CSS Methods

************************************************************************************************************************

01 - Methods for Adding CSS

In this exercise, you're going to practice adding CSS to an HTML file using all three methods: external CSS, internal 
CSS, and inline CSS. You should only be using type selectors for this exercise when adding styles via the external and 
internal methods. You should also use keywords for colors (e.g. "blue") instead of using RGB or HEX values.

There are three elements for you to add styles to, each of which uses a different method of adding CSS to it, as noted 
in the outcome image below. All other exercises in this section will have a CSS file provided and linked for you, but 
for this exercise you will have to create the file and link it in the HTML file yourself. This is all about practicing 
using these different methods and getting the syntax right.

Quick tip:                                                    

Do not worry about details in these exercises that are not specifically mentioned in the exercise or self check section. 
Because the desired outcomes are screenshots, your browser may show a different font, the colors may appear different 
on your machine, or the spacing between elements may look different. Only concern yourself with the specific items you 
are supposed to be learning for each exercise.

The properties you need to add to each element are:

* div: a red background, white text, a font size of 32px, center aligned, and bold
* p: a green background, white text, and a font size of 18px
* button: an orange background and a font size of 18px
